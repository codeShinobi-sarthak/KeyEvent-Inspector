# üïµÔ∏èKeyEvent Inspector

KeyEvent Inspector is a simple web application that provides real-time insights into keyboard events. Whenever a key is pressed, this app captures and displays detailed information about the event, including the key itself, keycode, code, and various modifier states (e.g., Alt, Ctrl, Shift, Meta).

## Features

- **Live Key Event Display**: Instantly shows the key pressed along with detailed information.
- **Detailed Table View**: Displays key event properties in a neatly formatted table.
- **Dark Theme**: Designed with a modern dark theme to reduce eye strain.
- **Modifier Keys Detection**: Identifies if Alt, Ctrl, Shift, or Meta keys were pressed.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Works across modern web browsers.

## Event Properties Displayed

- **KEY**: The actual key that was pressed (e.g., "a", "Enter", "Shift").
- **KEYCODE**: The numeric code representing the key.
- **CODE**: The physical key on the keyboard (e.g., "KeyA", "Enter").
- **ALT KEY**: Whether the "Alt" key was pressed.
- **CTRL KEY**: Whether the "Ctrl" key was pressed.
- **SHIFT KEY**: Whether the "Shift" key was pressed.
- **META KEY**: Whether the "Meta" key (e.g., Command on Mac) was pressed.
- **REPEAT**: Indicates if the key is being held down and repeating.
- **TIMESTAMP**: The time when the event occurred (in milliseconds since the page loaded).
- **LOCATION**: The location of the key on the keyboard (e.g., standard, left, right, numpad).
